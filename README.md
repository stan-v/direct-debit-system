# Direct Debit System

The Direct Debit System is a Java desktop program that can 
simplify administration tasks surrounding payment 
from users or members of an association. It integrates
direct debit orders to a bank and mailing personalized
message to the users or members about the costs the 
have made. 

I originally made this project in 2017 to automate the 
payment flow of members to an association for membership fees
and the likes. 

At the time I made this application, I had no knowledge about 
Java Lists, HashMaps, JSON and any other best practices. 
For that reason, I unknowingly reinvented many wheels during 
the development of this project. Naturally, I would have done 
many things differently if I were to develop something
like this today. 

It is also evident that this project is not fit to be used 
like this, and it certainly is not user-friendly in the way 
it is built. I also did not have in mind that anyone else would 
ever have to work on this project.
In the event that one may find anything
useful in this project, I'd love to hear about it :)
